# Third Party
Manage third party scripts and pixels (tags); like GTM but not.

## Why?
Because sometimes GTM is overkill. It may be...
- A client is going to take over managing their site and GTM is just another
thing they have to learn/deal with.
- You only have a couple scripts that need to be added and don't need the full
GTM experience but still want to edit tags without a dev.
- Some vendor scripts simply don't work through GTM.
- You're a rebel, Dottie.

## Why Not?
Realistically GTM is a very powerful tool. If you need anything more complicated
than, "run these tags on these pages", you should consider it.

Although, you can use Third Party to load GTM, just saying.
